====== 1. PCA - Problem Formulation ======
Created Friday 31 July 2020

PCA(**Principle Component Analysis**) is an algorithm for dimensionality reduction. 
Let's formuate what we'd like PCA to do.

* Mean normalization should be done before performing PCA.
PCA choosen a low dimensional surface.

The small blue line(‚ä• to red line) are called the projection errors.
