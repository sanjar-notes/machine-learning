* Only **square** matrices have inverses, coz determinant is undefined for non-square matrices.
* A good analogue for 'if has an inverse' - is ifDet(A)=0. Such a matrix is also called a singular or degenerate matrix.
* We don't need the visualization of inverse in this course.


*****

Matrix transpose:
Write all rows as columns.(or vice versa)
