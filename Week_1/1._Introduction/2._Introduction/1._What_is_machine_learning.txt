====== 1. What is machine learning ======
Created Monday 16 March 2020

Let us give a formal definition to ML.
We will try to define ML and **when** to use ML.

Ways of how people think about it, coz a **consensus is absent**:
1. Arthur Samuel(1959): Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. A computer learns because it is patient. Humans are not.
	This is somewhat informal as a definition.
2. Tom Mitchell(1998): A computer program is said to **learn from experience** E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.
	This looks better.
	
* It is more important to learn to use these tools, than to learn the tools in a very good way. 
* We are gonna spend a lot of time developing a ML system. Serious ML and AI systems.
Intuition: ML makes sense. Great.

* Samuel made a checkers playing program which used unsupervised learning. 
* **We don't need to understand **what **learn **means for us and the computers, we accept this definition as ML. Simple.

Types of ML:
1. Supervised learning - We have some cases with the correct answers.
2. Unsupervised learning - We let the machine experiment on its own.
