* This visualization can be difficult if we have many features.
--------------------
The standard way to evaluate an hypothesis is:
1. We split the training example into two parts(70-30), 30% being the test data. 
	If the data is sorted, it is better to randomize it before splitting.

2. Computing the error:
	 We just calculate the cost function in case of linear regression.

	For logistic regression, in addition to the cost function, we can also define a error function:
