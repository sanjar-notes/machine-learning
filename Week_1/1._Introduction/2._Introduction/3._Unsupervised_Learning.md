# 3. Unsupervised Learning
Created Monday 01 June 2020

Unsupervised learning allows us to approach problems with little or no idea about what the results are going to look like. We can derive the structure from data where we don't necessarily  know the effect of the variables.

We can derive this structure by clustering the data based on **relationships** among the variables in the data.

With unsupervised learning there is no feedback based on the results, because we don't have any.

Some of the unsupervised learning algorithms are:

1. **Clustering: **We can visualize and see that data is segregated here.

Examples:

1. Google News - Clusters the similar stories from different sources.
2. Gene Sub-arrays - How much genes we have in common.
3. Facebook - Identify cohesive groups of people.
4. Computer clusters - The devices which work together, which could be clustered together at a place.
5. Astronomical data analysis - Find out relations between the data, this helps in making/testing theories.
6. Trading data - Segmenting the market to help find useful products for the population.

2. **Cocktail party problem:**

We take data from multiple sources(superimposed, mixed) and separate it on the basis of the source.
Example: 

1. Two people speaking simultaneously, two microphones record the conversation, and they are in different positions. We can separate the voices.
2. Music playing and someone talking - Two microphones record this, we can separate the parts out.

**This seem to be very complicated: We need to write audio processing code using C++/Java.**

*But it can be done in one line on code.*

svd - a linear algebra routine built into octave.

* We need the correct environment for solving problems like these. **Octave **Programming environment makes it easy. It is free and open-source.
* We learn faster if we use Octave, as opposed to C++/Java/Python. It is also good for prototyping.
* Development time is very crucial, so it is better to first prototype the algorithms in high level languages.
