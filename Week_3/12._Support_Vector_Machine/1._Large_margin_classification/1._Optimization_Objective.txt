* Alternative view of logistic regression.

* If we have y=1, we want h() to be 1, i.e z >> 0, i.e e^{-z} be very small.
We know, about the cost function for logistic regression

here, we can assume the slope to be (pink-straight line curve):
{{./pasted_image002.png}} {{./pasted_image003.png}}
* We name these functions cost1 and cost0.
* We can now, **build **SVMs:
	a. We write the cost function for logistic regression, by placing cost0 and cost1

	b. We get rid of the 1/m terms. This is easy because m is a constant being multiplied, i.e it does't affect the minimization process

	c. We can write the cost for the support vector machine. Traditionally it is changed to look like CAB, where c = 1/Î»

	d. Unlike the logistic regression, the SVM gives a binary output, because it is not a rounded curve:
