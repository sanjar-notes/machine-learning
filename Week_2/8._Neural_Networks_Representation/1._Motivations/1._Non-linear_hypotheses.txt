====== 1. Non-linear hypotheses ======
Created Friday 12 June 2020

* We'll learn about an ML paradigm called Artificial Neural Network(ANN).
* It's old.
* It was popular at a time, then died down, then resurged. It is now accepted and used as a state-of-the-art ML algorithm, partly due to the increase in computing power, which makes it much more practical now.
--------------------
Why do we need ANNs, if we already have linear regression and classification algorithms?
* ANNs are useful where the hypothesis are complex and/or non-linear.

This is okay if the number of features are less.
Example: For housing prediction, we can come up with a lot of features ~ 100. If we were to include all of features with a maximum degree of 2. We'd have around 5000 features.
* For n features and maximum degree r, number of terms = ^{n}C_{1}+^{n}C_{2}+ ... + ^{n}C_{r }= O(n^{r}/r!)
Problems with this:
1. Overfitting is very likely to occur.
2. Computationally very expensive. O(kn^{2}) = O(kn^{2r}) ~ exponential, as r >>1
3. Decreasing the features will simplify the decision boundaries, and so it is nearly impossible to get such an intricate classifier. Even for small values of r, because n will be very large.

--------------------
For many ML problems, n is pretty large. e.g Computer Vision
* This is because each pixel is a feature. And even if we take a small part, say the door handle of a car, a x * y image. n becomes = x*y, that too for a grayscale image.
* The computer/camera sees a pixel matrix.

--------------------
Let us make a classifier for detecting whether the picture is of a car or not.
* We'll first choose certain parts of which will act as our features.
	{{./pasted_image004.png?width=500}}
* The dataset can be represented as:
	{{./pasted_image005.png?width=350}} the outcome should be {{./pasted_image006.png?width=350}}
* The number of features is very high:

--------------------
It can be concluded that //these applications// cannot be solved by using regression(logistic in this case).
