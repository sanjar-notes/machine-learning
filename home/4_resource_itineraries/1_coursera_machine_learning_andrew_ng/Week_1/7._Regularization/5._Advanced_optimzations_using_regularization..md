# 5. Advanced optimizations using regularization.
Created Wednesday 10 June 2020

Like plain linear regression, we need to provide a function which computes the cost function and the derivative term for all the parameters. And give it to the fminunc(@costFunction)

* Note that θ~0 ~is handled the same as non-regularized one. We need an extra statement because we are updating everything, and α is the same for all.


*****


* There are many engineers that make a ton of money and great products using ML.
* But now we know much more than those engineers.
* We can starts working on many problems.


*****

We'll learn even more powerful algorithms, non-linear classification algorithms in order to solve harder problems.
