# 3. Backpropagation Intuition
Created Monday 15 June 2020


* "The backpropagation looks like a black box!" - Popular remark
* Professor Ng himself is sometimes not able to think about the steps. 
* In other words, the backpropagation algorithm is a very long algorithm, difficult to keep it in mind, together.
* It's okay.


*****

We'll take the example of this ANN, to demonstrate the backpropagation term.

1. Forward propagation: Calculate the Î˜, a and z for all the layers.

* Note that we don't calculate the delta terms for the bias units, as they don't affect the gradient.
