====== 3. Choosing what features to use ======
Created Sunday 02 August 2020

Features directly affect the performance of anomaly detection algorithms:
We modeled the feature using Gaussian distribution.
For non gaussian data, we can make our data gaussian by applying some tranformations like log(x), âˆšx etc

**Error analysis** for anomaly detection:
Want p(x) large for normal examples x.
p(x) is small for anomalous examples x. 
**Most common problem**
	p(x) is comparable(say, both large) for normal and anomalous examples.
