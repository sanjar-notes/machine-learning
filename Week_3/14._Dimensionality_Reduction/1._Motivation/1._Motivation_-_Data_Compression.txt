====== 1. Motivation - Data Compression ======
Created Friday 31 July 2020

What is dimensionality reduction?
If we have redundant features, they are a problem, take up disk space and make our learning algorithms slow. Reduction of features is thus, very important.
e.g length in cm, length in inches. pilot skill, pilot enjoyment.

* Selecting two features and making a single feature using them.

* In real life, we may need to do 1000 D â†’  100 D.

* Most of the points in the 3D cloud lied on the same plane. Hence, they could be obtained as a projection tof that common 3D plane.
* Dimensionality reduction helps in data compression.
