# 1. Motivation

I know how to do computation on basic structures - numbers, lists, 
trees, graphs. But it's important to be able to do this for more 
advanced structures like audio, picture, video etc. The tool used 
for computing on these 'advanced' structures is based on statistics 
and aspects of artificial intelligence.

So, one reason I want to do ML is to efficiently work with 
these advanced structures.

This reason may not seem to be the core of machine learning, which 
is to program machines without explicitly doing so. I wish to do 
that as well.

These are the two reasons why I wish to learn machine learning.
