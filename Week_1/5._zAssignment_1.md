*****

Insert code for plotting:

1. plot(x, y, 'ct', 'MarkerSize', 10) - This plots points of type 't' and color 'c' of size 10.
2. computeCost - had to solve using pen and paper.
3. gradientDescent.m - had to solve using pen and paper.


*****

ext1data2.txt - contains data in the following way.
| Sr.No | x0 | Area(x1) | Number of bedrooms(x2) | Price(y) |
|:-----:|:--:|:--------:|:----------------------:|:--------:|
|       | 1  |  1000*b  |           b            |          |


4. featureNormalize.m:
	1. Subtract each area by the mean, i.e A - μ
	2. Divide each area now by the σ
	3. i.e for each area, do A = (A-μ)/σ, **make sure that sigma!=0 before doing the calculations.**

How do we calculate sigma, for a vector A, σ = std(A)

5. Other ones were also very easy, just do algebra on paper first.
