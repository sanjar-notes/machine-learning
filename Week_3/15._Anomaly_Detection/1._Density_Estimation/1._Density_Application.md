Anomaly detection is a problem in ML.
We need to check if something should be tested more thorougly. We are given a set of non-anomalous examples. Need to assign the probability of anomaly.

e.g 

1. Manufacturing - We work at an aircraft engine factory. We have a set of non-anamolous engines. We need to predict for a new engine, the degree of anamoly for it.
2. Fraud detection - Identify unusual behavior among a pool of users - depends on a forum, typing speed.
3. Monitor computers in a data center - CPU load/network traffic.
