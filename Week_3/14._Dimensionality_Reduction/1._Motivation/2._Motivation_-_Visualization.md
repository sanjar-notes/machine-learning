Created Friday 31 July 2020

This is the second application of dimensionality reduction, visualization.
This helps is in finding insights and help make our learning algorithms better.

*****

Suppose we have a table of countries with 50 facts about them.

This data cannot be visualized by us, because it is 50 D. But we can visualize at most 3D data. We need to find a equivalent representation with 3 features or less.

We reduced(somehow) the data from 50 â†’ 2 D. The process of visualization does not guarantee semantic practicality of the new terms, it is up to us to judge and define them.
