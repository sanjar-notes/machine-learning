Created Sunday 14 June 2020

There are 10 digits, in postcards. 
For multi-class classification, the final layer has 10 activation units rather than just one. These outputs of these units represent the probability of the class. We pick the highest probability one. We follow the **one vs all **approach.

The correct answer is represented by a column vector, rather than an integer value.
