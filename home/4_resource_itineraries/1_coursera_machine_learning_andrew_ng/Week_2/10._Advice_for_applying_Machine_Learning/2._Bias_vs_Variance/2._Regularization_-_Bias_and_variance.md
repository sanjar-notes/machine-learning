# 2. Regularization - Bias and variance
Created Sunday 21 June 2020


* We know that regularization decreases **overfitting** in our hypotheses.
* How does regularization affect bias and variance?

### How to choose the regularization parameter 位?

* Note that the error terms **do not **involve the regularization parameter.
* To choose 位, do the following by trial and error, and select the one with the least CV error.

### How do bias/variance vary as a function of regularization parameter 位

* On a real data, the graph will be somewhat messy.
* By doing this we can **choose** the right regularization parameter 位.

* We'll take all these insights to build a diagnostic tool called learning curves.
