In advanced optimization, 

* The 'theta' given is considered a vector(number of parameters)
* The gradients are also considered vectors.

But in ANNs, we have parameter matrices(Î˜^(l)^) and gradient matrices(D^(l)^).

To use fminunc, we need to **unroll** the matrices into vectors. Like this:

Unrolling them:

To get back the vectors we do this:

*****

The whole process is:

1. We have our initial parameters(matrices) for parameters.
2. We unroll them.
3. Cost function and derivatives are calculated.
4. Derivatives are unrolled to get the gradient matrices.
