# 1. Diagnosing Bias vs variance
Created Sunday 21 June 2020


* More bias(underfitting) and high variance(overfitting) are both a problem for our hypotheses.

* How do these two problems affect our hypotheses:

* How to check if we are underfitting or overfitting? We can do so by plotting the errors for the three datasets.
