# 3. Matrix Multiplication properties
Created Wednesday 03 June 2020


1. In general, A * B != B *A , even if they are square matrices. **Commutative**
	1. a*b and b*c - clearly not commutative, as only one way is possible.
	2. a*b and b*a - clearly not commutative, as two different outputs are possible.
	3. a*a and a*a - not necessarily commutative. We found a counter-example.

2. Matrix multiplication **is** **associative**.

A*B*C = (A*B)*C = A*(B*C)
Consequently, **grouping** is allowed.

3. I~nxn~ is the identity matrix. It is a square matrix. It has 1's along the diagonal, all others are 0.

* Identity matrix is commutative with any other matrix, in multiplication.
