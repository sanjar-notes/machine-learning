====== 1. Implementation Note - Unrolling parameters ======
Created Friday 19 June 2020

In advanced optimization, 
* The 'theta' given is considered a vector(number of parameters)
* The gradients are also considered vectors.
But in ANNs, we have parameter matrices(Î˜^{(l)}) and gradient matrices(D^{(l)}).

To use fminunc, we need to **unroll** the matrices into vectors. Like this:

Unrolling them:

To get back the vectors we do this:

--------------------
The whole process is:
1. We have our initial parameters(matrices) for parameters.
2. We unroll them.
3. Cost function and derivatives are calculated.
4. Derivatives are unrolled to get the gradient matrices.
