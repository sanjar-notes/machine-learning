* It signifies **substitution **of values, yielding the answers.
* Orders have to be coherent because number of data values per datum  = number of variables should hold.

* For calculating the value of h(x) for each of the houses, which is actually a substitution, can be represented as a matrix and vector multiplication.
* This representation helps when we implement this in software. It saves us from hard-coding the order, i.e number of for loops. Writing for loops is outright wrong, coz we don't know the orders before hand.

We can use this notation in matrix.![](./1._Multiplication_-_Matrix,_Vector/pasted_image002.png)
