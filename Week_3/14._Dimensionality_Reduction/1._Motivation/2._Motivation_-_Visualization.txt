====== 2. Motivation - Visualization ======
Created Friday 31 July 2020

This is the second application of dimensionality reduction, visualization.
This helps is in finding insights and help make our learning algorithms better.
--------------------
Suppose we have a table of countries with 50 facts about them.
{{./pasted_image.png}}
This data cannot be visualized by us, because it is 50 D. But we can visualize at most 3D data. We need to find a equivalent representation with 3 features or less.
{{./pasted_image001.png}}
We reduced(somehow) the data from 50 â†’ 2 D. The process of visualization does not guarantee semantic practicality of the new terms, it is up to us to judge and define them.
