====== 1. Prioritizing what to work on ======
Created Thursday 23 July 2020

* How to strategize the work when designing ML systems.
* This is less mathematical, but is important and may save us lots of time.
--------------------
We'll take the example of a spam classifier.
{{./pasted_image.png?width=550}}
* The spam emails have spelling errors.
* We are using supervised learning, logistic regression.
* How to select features - we may select 100 words and tag them as being spam email words or not. Then we may train a classifier for the emails - like deal, buy now, !!!, etc. This can be done semi-automatically by seeing the word frequency.
* For each email, our feature is a 1/0 vector, if there is a feature word we have, it is 1 else 0.
* How can we make our classifier?
	a. Collect more data
	b. Develop sophisticated features based on email routing information(from email header)
	c. Punctuations, capital words etc.
	d. Detect spelling errors.
* Don't get fixated on a certain accuracy betterment idea, just because it came to your head. We can use **error-analysis** which helps us in making more systematic decisions.
